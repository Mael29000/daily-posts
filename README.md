# 🚧 Issues

-   The MUI component "Masonry" is in beta and has some issues with the responsiveness. I had to use a workaround to make it work. I figured that despite it looks great, it add a lot of complexity to the code and I would have been better off using a simple grid. Hope it wont trigger errors on your side.
